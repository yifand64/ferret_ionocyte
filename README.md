# ferret_ionocyte
 Code repository for interspecies comparison between mouse, ferret, and human
This code repository contains quick start R code for the analysis of 4180 pulmonary rare cells (Ionocyte, neuroendocrine, and tuft) from mouse, human, and ferret. The easiest way to run it is to clone the repo (download ZIP button at top) and open the file 'interspecies_integration_v2.Rmd' in RStudio. Each code chunk can then be run by clicking the run button (top right corner of each chunk).
